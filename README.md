# DECA-Spring-Term-Lab-Challenges

Lab2:Challenge


My initial design took inspiration from the example showed to us from the lecture, I was struggling to start the challenge so I decided to take this basic design for a 3x3 multiplier and extend it to 16x16 multiplier. This initial design can be found in [Multiplier Issie Design] (#mult.dgm). This design however is not compliant with the 64 adder limit.
