# DECA-Spring-Term-Lab-Challenges

Lab2:Challenge


My initial design took inspiration from the example showed to us from the lecture, I was struggling to start the challenge so I decided to take this basic design for a 3x3 multiplier and extend it to 16x16 multiplier, and then I will improve the design further to see how I can make it faster. This initial design can be found in [Multiplier Issie Design] (mult.dgm)
